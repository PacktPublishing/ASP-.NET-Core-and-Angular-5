Writing code is about striking a balance between maintainability and productivity—how quickly you can write it against how much more you have to write in the future. This is a guide that will help you become fluent in both frontend and backend web development by combining the impressive capabilities of ASP.NET Core 2 and Angular 5, from project setup right through the deployment phase. Not only will you learn how Angular 2 can complement your .NET skills and toolkit, you'll also learn everything you need to build a complete dynamic single-page application.

You will use the ASP.NET Core MVC framework to implement a backend with API calls and server-side routing. You will also learn how to put the frontend together using top-notch Angular 5 features for a responsive and mobile-friendly UI
